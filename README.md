## Introduction to HTML and CSS in depth

- The next HTML section will focus on bringing websites to life with media elements. You will learn how to embed video and audio players and even **iframes**.

- Following the module about HTML, is when all about **CSS**. This part of the course will go beyond basic **styling**. You will learn how to create layouts with grids and flex boxes. You will also learn about CSS **selectors** and how you can combine them to refine the styling of elements on your web pages.

- Not only that, but you'll also learn how to use **pseudo-class selectors** to improve the interactivity of a web page. But there's even more. You will learn how to add effects on web pages using purely CSS and you will cover basic transform and transition animations, as well as more advanced animations using **key frames**.

## How are HTML and CSS used in the real-world?

- By you know that **HTML** is a markup language for creating webpages. Together with **CSS**, it has helped the web browser expand beyond just desktop computers.

- HTML has been around since 1990, and it was originally designed to provide a way for people to share information over the Internet. HTML webpages used to only show basic images and text.

- But HTML can do much more than just defining how content is displayed in the browser. CSS is a **stylesheet** language that is used to describe **the look** and **layout** of a document written in HTML. While CSS is not a **programming language**, it does allow for some programming like features such as **variables** and **nested rules**.

- CSS gives you control over **color**, **size**, **spacing**, **fonts**, **positioning** and more. One of the fundamental principles of CSS is the **separation of content and style**.

## Semantics tags and why we need them

- The basic HTMl semantis is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>

## Metadata

- It is pretty clear that each person uses a search engine on a web browser to find their favorite things or their queries. Everytime you do a searh, the search engine returns a list of results that are relevant to the searched keywords, but how does actually happen?

- A major part of launching a website is a process called **Search Engine Optimization** or **SEO**. This process involves making improvements to a website's content semantics and delivery to improve its ranking in search results. When a search engine analyzes an htnl doc of a website, it finds a link to another html doc, it follows the link to that document and continues following links until it is finished analyzing the entire site. Every search engine has its own algorithm for ranking websites based on the content of sites. But for now just let's focus on how **meta** tags influence the ranking of websites.

- Meta tags define metadata about a webpage. It is the data about other data which in this case is data about the webpage. Meta tags are usually added inside the **head** element of an html doc, and content of head element is not displayed on the web browser. Remember that when we called out some basic examples, there is no closing tag for meta tags, unlike other elements. Each meta element consists of two attributes: **name** and **content**. The **name** attribute defines the name of the meta data of that certain website while **content** specifies the value of the meta data.

- Let's checkout some of the examples of meta data. The **author** metadata specifies the author of the webpage. Here name attribute is author and the content can be a person or company.

## Metadata Cheat Sheet

### Name

- The name of the property can be anything you like, although browsers usually expect a value they understand and can take an action upon. An example would be <code>&lt;meta name="author" content="name of author"&gt;</code> to state the author of the page.

### Content

- The content field specifies the property's value. For example, you can use <code>&lt;meta name="language" content="english"&gt;</code>, to specify the language of the webpage to search engines.

### Charset

- The charset is a special field that lets you specify the character encoding used for the page so that the browser can display it properly. The most frequently used is **UTF-8**, and you would add it to your HTML header as: <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>.

### HTTP-equiv

- This attribute stands for **HTTP equivalent**, and it's used to simulate http response headers. This is rare to see, and it's recommended to use http headers over html http-equiv meta tags. For example, the following tag would instruct the browser to refresh the page every 30 minutes: <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"&gt;</code>.

## Basic Meta Tags(meta tags for SEO)

- The description meta tag provides a brief description of the webpage.

```html
<meta name="description" />
```

- Title meta tag defines the title of the webpage.

```html
<meta name="title" />
```

- Author meta tag specifies the author of the page.

```html
<meta name="author" content="name" />
```

- Language meta tag specifies the language.

```html
<meta name="language" content="english" />
```

- The following meta tag tells search engines how to crawl or index a certain page.

```html
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
```

- The following says Google not to show the sitelinks search box for your page when showing search results.

```html
<meta name="google" />
```

- This tells Google you don't want to provide an automatic translation for your page if the user uses a different language.

```html
<meta name="googlebot" content="notranslate" />
```

- This specifies the last modified date and time on which you have made certain changes.

```html
<meta name="revised" content="Friday, September 16th, 2022, 12:09pm" />
```

- The following specifies the expected audience for your page.

```html
<meta name="rating" content="safe for kids" />
```

- This specifies a Copyright.

```html
<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2022" />
```

### HTTP-equiv Tags

- This describes the format of the doc returned by the server.

```html
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html" />
```

- This specifies the format of the styling doc.

```html
<meta http-equiv="default-style" />
```

- Following specifies the duration of the page before it's considered state.

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" />
```

- This specifies the language of the page.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-language" />
```

- Following instructs the browser how to cache your page.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache" />
```

### Responsive Design Meta Tags

- This indicates that telephone numbers should appear as hypertext links that can be clicked to make a phone call.

```html
<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=yes" />
```

- It specifies that the page can be properly visualized on mobile devices.

```html
<meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="true" />
```

- The following specifies the area of the window in which web content can be seen.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

## Bare Bones Layout

- An important part of being a web devloper is not only the tools you use, such as your integrated devlopment environment, but also the repository of knowledge and code templates you build up over time.

- Let's learn one of these templates, which will help in building webpages easily and quickly. In our example template, we've an html document called <code>index.html</code>, a JS folder and a CSS folder. Inside the JS folder, there's a file called <code>script.js</code> and there's no content in this file for now. Similarly there's a file called <code>style.css</code> inside the CSS folder. Again the style.css is all empty. It is best to use some example script.js and style.css files in their respective directories.

- In this basic template, remember that the style.css file is always placed inside the head element of index.html, using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. Like that the script.js can be linked using <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, inside the footer of body element.

```

5. **How do you tell Google you don't want to provide an automation translation for your page if the user uses a different language?**<br>
   _ans._

```html
<meta name="”googlebot”" content="”notranslate”" />
```

6. **Which statements are true about HTTp-equiv tags?**<br>
   _ans._ They can simulate HTTP response headers; they are useful if you don't have access to the server configuration.

## Layout Design

- As you build web pages throughout your career, you'll notice that many pages follow similar layouts and structures. This is the outcome of many years of researh into user interface design and user experience.

### Top Navbar Layout

- Websites often have a top navbar layout to provide a set of essential anchor links to the user. These typically link to the main areas of the website, such as product pages. This provides the visitor to the website with a consistent navigation experience.<br>

### Carousel Layout

- Product and online-shopping websites often use a large carsoul on their homepage to highlight their featured products, offers and discounts. The carousel contains content items that will keep rotating through the carousel area at a fixed interval.<br>

### Blog Layout

- The blog layout is used to feature multiple content items of differing importance. It is often seen on news websites where new articles will appear on the page each day based on current happenings.<br>

- The layout typically features different-sized feature areas followed by a series of article summary areas that link to full articles.

### Dashboard Layout

- Dashboard layouts are often used in enterprise software for managing various web applications. They typically feature a sidebar for navigation with the main content area containing forms for configuration or reporting data such as graphs and tables. This trendy layout provides a good user experience for business users.

## UX with Meta tags

- Social networks are a great tool to share content with friends and family, and even with co-workers and business partners. When you share a link, most social networks generate a preview of the link to let users know what the shared webpage about.

- You will learn how Meta tags help webpages create preview of other webpages. By using Meta tags to control what information is displayed to users, you can get more clicks when you share your websites. But the meta tags web devlopers use this purpose are different from the traditional SEO Meta tags as the SEO Meta tags are oriented towards search results, not direct links.

- Facebook's rapid growth led to millions of users sharing thousands of links everyday. To improve the UX, they had to find a way to display information about a website before a user clicks on the link. To address this challenge, Facebook established the **Open Graph Protocol** in 2010. The Open Graph Protocol is set of Metadata rules that allow webpages to describe themeselves to social networks.

- There are a lot of Meta tags available within Open Graph Protocol, but before we dive into that, let's see how the Open Graph Protocol Metadata is defined. We've already learned that Meta tags are usually placed inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of an html document, the Open Graph Protocol also uses Meta tags added to the head element, but there's a slight difference.
  <br>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Regular SEO oriented Meta tags -->
    <meta name="author" content="Ritukanta Reddy" />

    <!-- One of the Open Graph Protocol Meta tags -->
    <meta property="og:title" content="My First Web Page" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- The Open Graph Protocol use the <code>property</code> attribute instead of <code>name</code> attribute, to define the Metadata name. Then, like regular SEO Meta tags, it uses the <code>content</code> attribute to define the Metadata value. Each property in the Open Graph Protocol starts with <code>og</code> followed by a colon (og:), as a convention to identify it as an Open Graph Protocol related tag.

- The Open Graph Protocol requires that you must always include four properties on a webpage. There are **title**, **type**, **url** and **image**.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- title property of Open Graph Protocol -->
    <meta property="og:title" content="My First Web Page" />

    <!-- type property -->
    <meta property="og:type" content="website" />

    <!-- url property -->
    <meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/" />

    <!-- image property -->
    <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/me.png" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- The title property defines the title of the page, this is the text that will appear in the preview. The type property defines the type of content, such as website, videos, music or article. The URL property defines the permanent web address that the social networks must use for the specific page. The image property defines a url to an image that must display when the website is shared. Together these Open Graph Protocol properties enables social media platforms to create a preview of the shared web link.

- There are also several other optional properties: the description property provides a description of the webpage. The locale property describes the language and territory of the webpage's content. And the site_name property describes the name of the overall website that the webpage belongs to.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- other Open Graph Protocol optional properties -->
    <meta
      property="og:description"
      content="My webpage is all about bla bla bla!"
    />

    <!-- "en" stands for English language and "US" stands for United States, territory -->
    <meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" />

    <meta property="og:site_name" content="Dale's Webpage" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Social Media Cards

- Before Facebook introduced the **Open Graph Protocol (OGP)**, search engine web crawlers, including social media websites, used the internal heuristics of a website to make the best possible guess in terms of the title, description, and preview images to be used for the content. This often led to social networks not completely successfully interpreting the post or information shared in the URL provided. Even today sometimes when you open a link for a website, the preview generated will be an out-of-scale image or a random image that is possibly embedded somewhere within the web page. This is where meta tags come in to help the end-user take better control of their content.

#### Need for social media cards

- With the number of users and the use of internet marketing on the rise, user attention is the currency. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words and the internet is a living proof of it: a caption and image can drive users towards or away from a website. The title and description shared with an URL should summarize the contents of a web page. In some cases, it may refer to generic information about the entire website. While for others you may tailor the social media (SM) card for a specific page on a website that you’re sharing. ‘type’ is an important OGP tag in SM cards that help describe the details of a link such as if it’s a book, article, movie and so on, and provide more detailed metadata for specific types. For example, in case of the music type, you can add details for the song, album, duration or any other information about the song. For a regular user scrolling through social media, the link provided with the image preview has only one chance and a moment’s attention to make a good impression. In such cases, the role of social media cards becomes very important.

#### Social media cards and SEO

- The internet today is an interconnected graph that is internally a web of URL links, web crawlers, and search engine optimization tools. Together, a web page’s image and title are the store front to invite the user. But the social media cards also play an important role in boosting the rankings for the web crawlers used by search engines. They provide the crawlers with the necessary information to build metadata that eventually helps in ranking websites. Additionally, it also helps track traffic to your website.

- While it’s advised to stick to the required tags in social media cards, a developer can also use auxiliary tags that may be suitable. For example, the use of the video tag that helps to play in-line when displayed on social media websites like Meta.

## Setting Up a Social Media Card

- **Little Lemon** restaurant has hired a marketing firm to help them advertise their business.

- So now we've to prepare a web page so that can be linked to social media platforms. At a minimum, I have to add four pieces of metadata required by the protocol.

```html
<!-- four mandatory social media meta tags and metadata(Open Graph Protocol) -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Our Menu" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:image" content="logo.png" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://littlelemon.com" />
```

- So I have added four meta tags inside the <code>head</code> element of my <code>index.html</code>.

- On the first meta tag, I add the <code>property</code> attribute and give it a value of <code>og:title</code>, followed by the <code>content</code> attribute with its value 'Our Menu'. This metadata is the title that will be displayed in the preview on social media platforms.

- On the second metadata, for the property attribute I add value of <code>og:type</code> and I add the content attribute and set its value to 'website'. This metadata describes social media platforms that this content being shared is a website.

- On the third meta tag, I add the property attribute and set its value to <code>og:image</code>. I then add logo.png' to the content attribute. This metadata helps in previewing our web page's logo. So it's good to link our restaurant logo to it.

- On the fourth meta tag, I add the property attribute and set its value to <code>og:url</code>. And I then add the content attribute to set to a value of our main website link i.e. "https://littlelemon.com". The webpage is now ready to shared but however, there is some optional metadata I can add to provide extra information to the social media platforms. So I'll add three more meta tags inside the <code>head</code> element.

- On the first one, I add the property attribute and set its value to <code>og:description</code> and then add "Little Lemon restaurant is a family-owned restarant, focused on traditional recipes ......" to the content attribute.

- On the second meta tag, I add the property attribute and set its value to <code>og:locale</code>. Then I add the content value to "en_US". This clearly specifies that the website is written and read in US English.

- On the last one, I add property attribute to give it a value <code>og:site_name</code>. I then add the content attribute and set its value to "Little Lemon" as it would our main website name.

- The Little Lemon website is now ready for big social media campaign.

## Forms and Validation

- Capturing the user input is one thing, but the form also needs to ensure that the data is valid and usable.

- **Form validation** is the process that ensures that the data entered by the user in the form is the valid and conforms the rules defined by the developer.

- Form validation is of two types: **client-side** and **server-side**.

- Client-side validation checks for errors as soon as the user is typed into the form. This is done by the web browser or the JavaScript code, and provide the user with a quick alert. For example, if you use the input element with its type attribute set to "email" and do not enter a valid email address with a acceptable domain, it will display an error.

- On the other hand, server-side validation checks for errors after the data has been submitted to the web server. This is more secure because it prevents malicious users from tampering with your webpage's code and submitting invalid data to your web server. This validation can run more complex checks, such as checking the data against a database, or validating the data against business requirements.

- HTML has several input type attributes that are used for form validation. Such as in the previous example, <code>email</code> is used for email addresses. Others include <code>url</code> for URLs, <code>tel</code> for telephone or phone numbers, <code>date</code> for date values, <code>time</code> for time values, <code>number</code> for numeric values, <code>range</code> for numeric values which have a minimum and maximum values and <code>color</code> for color selection.

- Say some user types a telephone number in the place of URL, the client-side validation will immediately alert them with a proper suggetion or feedback. Another attribute <code>required</code> ensures the user must enter the value, otherwise they won't be able to submit the form.

## Input Type(Cheat Sheet)

#### Button

- This displays a clickable button and it is mostly used in the HTML forms to activate a script when clicked. <code>&lt;input type="button" value="Click me" onclick="msg()"/&gt;</code>.

- Keep in mind you can also define buttons with the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag, with the added benefit of being able to place content like text or images inside the tag.

```html
<button onclick="alert('Are you sure you want to continue?')">
  <img
    src="https://yourserver.com/button_img.jpg"
    alt="Submit the form"
    height="64"
    width="64"
  />
</button>
```

#### Checkbox

- Defines a check box allowing single values to be selected or deselected. They are used to let a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices.

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="dog" name="dog" value="Dog">
<label for="dog">I like dogs</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="cat" name="cat" value="Cat">
<label for="cat">I like cats</label>
```

#### Radio

- Displays a radio button, allowing only a single value to be selected out of multiple choices. They are normally presented in radio groups, which is a collection of radio buttons describing a set of related options that share the same "name" attribute.

```html
<input type="radio" id="light" name="theme" value="Light">
<label for="light">Light</label>
<input type="radio" id="dark" name="theme" value="Dark">
<label for="dark">Dark</label>
```

#### Submit

- Displays a submit button for submitting all values from an HTML form to a form-handler, typically a server. The form-handler is specified in the form’s "action" attribute:

```html
<form action="myserver.com" method="POST">
  …
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

#### Text

- Defines a basic single-line text field that a user can enter text into.

```html
<label for="fname">First name:</label>
<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname">
```

#### Password

- Defines a single-lined text field that a user can enter text into.

```html
<label for="pwd">Password:</label>
<input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">
```

#### Date

- Displays a control for entering a date with no time (year, month and day).

```html
<label for="dob">Date of birth:</label>
<input type="date" id="dob" name="date of birth">
```

#### Datetime-local

- Defines a control for entering a date and time, including the year, month and day, as well as the time in hours and minutes.

```html
<label for="birthdaytime">Birthday (date and time):</label>
<input type="datetime-local" id="birthdaytime" name="birthdaytime">
```

#### Email

- Defines a field for an email address. it is similar to a plain text input, with the addition that it validates automatically when submitted to the server.

```html
<label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">
```

#### File

- Displays a control that lets the user select and upload a file from their computer. To define the types of files permissible you can use the "accept" attribute. Also, to enable multiple files to be selected, add the "multiple" attribute.

```html
<label for="myfile">Select a file:</label>
<input type="file" id="myfile" name="myfile">
```

#### Hidden

- Defines a control that is not displayed but whose value is still submitted to the server.

```html
<input type ="hidden"  id="custId"  name="custId"  value="3487"></input type>
```

#### Image

- Defines an image as a graphical submit button. You should use the “src” attribute to point to the location of your image file.

```html
<input type
  ="image"
  src="submit_img.png"
   alt="Submit"
   width="48"
   height="48"
></input type>
```

#### Number

- Defines a control for entering a number. You can use attributes to specify restrictions, such as min and max values allowed, number intervals or a default value.

```html
<input type
  ="number"
   id="quantity"
   name="quantity"
   min="1"
   max="5"
></input type>
```

#### Range

- Displays a range widget for specifying a number between two values. The precise value, however, is not considered important. This is typically represented using a slider or dial control. To define the range of acceptable values, use the “min” and “max” properties.

```html
<label for="volume">Volume:</label>
<input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="0" max="10">
```

#### Reset

- Displays a button that resets the contents of the form to their default values.

```html
<input type ="reset"></input type>
```

#### Search

- Defines a text field for entering a search query. These are functionally identical to text inputs, but may be styled differently depending on the browser.

```html
<label for="gsearch">Search in Google:</label>
<input type="search" id="gsearch" name="gsearch">
```

#### Time

- Displays a control for entering a time value in hours and minutes, with no time zone.

```html
<label for="appt">Select a time:</label>
<input type="time" id="appt" name="appt">
```

#### Tel

- Defines a control for entering a telephone number. Browsers that do not support “tel” fall back to standard text input. You can optionally use the "pattern" field to perform validation.

```html
<label for="phone">Enter your phone number:</label>
<input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern="[+]{1}[0-9]{11,14}">
```

#### Url

- Displays a field for entering a text URL. It works similar to a text input, but performs automatic validation before being submitted to the server.

```html
<label for="homepage">Add your homepage:</label>
<input type="url" id="homepage" name="homepage">
```

#### Week

- Defines a control for entering a date consisting of a week-year number and a year, with no time zone. Keep in mind that this is a newer type that is not supported by all the browsers.

```html
<input type ="week"  id="week"  name="week"></input type>
```

#### Month

- Displays a control for entering a month and year, with no time zone. Keep in mind that this is a newer type that is not supported by all the browsers.

```html
<label for="bdaymonth">Birthday (month and year):</label>
<input type="month" id="bdaymonth" name="bdaymonth" min="1930-01" value="2000-01">
```

## Creating a Form

- In this lesson, we are going to learn how to make a simple sign up form for user accounts for a online delivery website.

- For this I'll start off by the <code>form</code> element with the basic HTML document.

- But you need to send this form using an <code>HTTP</code> post request, it improves the data security of our form. For the user account sign up, the online food delivery website needs user's first name, last name, and email address and of course, the form also needs a field for password and another field to confirm the password.

- I'll create a form with five fields in total. I'll start by adding the <code>input</code> elements. First, I will set up six <code>div</code> elements, one for each input element and one for the signup button. The div elements will cause each field of the form to display in its own <code>CSS</code> block. Then I'll create the in same manner as <code>forms/index.html</code> document.

- After adding the <code>input</code> elements in each of div element, everything displays correctly. However we can improve the UX by informing the user what each field represents. To do this, I'll add a <code>label</code> element before each <code>input</code> element.

- Now we should know the reason why we added the ID attribute in the input element earlier, because it allows us to associate a label with each input element. Also the labels improve the user experience and assist accessibility software and understanding the form. In the last div element, add the <code>button</code> element and set the type attribute to "submit".

## Making the most of client-side validation

- Have you ever completed a form online and then after you've clicked on the submit button, one of the fields turned red. This happens when a field is empty or if a value is too long or too short.

- As a developer, you can use HTML and CSS to guide users to enter the correct formatted data in the fields and in this way, save the web server resources. In this lesson, we will learn more about the capabilities of client-side validation and how to use CSS to effectively alert users when data format is incorrect. There are several attributes for <code>input</code> element in HTML to validate the user data.

- Let's examine a Login form, where the web server needs a username and password to get submitted by using "Submit" or "Signin" button. What if the web server has no required format of user ID and password? This is surely the waste of web server and less secure. This is where server-side validation prevents processing of the request, a HTTP requst was still submitted though.

- Let's improve this form by using-client side validation to ensure the user eneters values of both fields. The <code>required</code> attribute helps us to alert the user telling the filed is empty and the submission request made by the user will not get submitted to the server.

```html
<form method="post">
  <div>
    <label for="username">Username</label><br />
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="user_password">Password</label><br />
    <input type="password" name="user_password" id="user_password" required />
  </div>
  <div>
    <button type="submit">Signin</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

- Now the user experience seems good but the user inputs being too short or too long can also make unnecessary submissions for the web server. To specify certain length of inputs, we can use <code>minlength=""</code> and <code>maxlength=""</code> attributes for setting atleast characters and maximum characters respectively.

```html
<form method="post">
  <label for="user">UserID</label><br />
  <input
    type="text"
    name="user"
    id="user"
    required
    minlength="3"
    maxlength="9"
  />

  <label for="pass">Password</label><br />
  <input
    type="password"
    name="pass"
    id="pass"
    required
    minlength="3"
    maxlength="6"
  />

  <br />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

- Let's focus on the way the browser communicates errors to the users, like a form field that turns red when the data format is invalid, this can be readily implemented using CSS. To highlight a field in red when the data is invalid, you use the input element selector. You then apply the pseudo-class selector called invalid.

```css
      <style>
        input:focus:invalid{
          border: 2px solid red;
        }
      </style>
```
